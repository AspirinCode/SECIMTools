@TIP_AND_WARNING@

**Tool Description**

**NOTE:** The tool is intended for the experiements where samples run sequentially via the instrument and where the sample processing order migh be associated with differences in samples characteristics.  The tool is is supposed to diagnose that by running regression analysis on the run order variable.  If the user does not have the run order variable saved as column in the design file this tool cannot be used as intended and should be skipped.

This tool fits simple linear regression rowwise using values for each feature as a response and sample run order as a linear predictor.  The goal is to identify whether there is any linear trend for each feature that changes over time and whether those trends are statistically significant.  The tool fits simple linear regression models for each row and provides the corresponding flags if the slope is statistically significant for two different levels of statistical significance (α = 0.05 and α = 0.01.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Input**

    - Two input datasets are required.

@WIDE@

**NOTE:** The sample IDs must match the sample IDs in the Design File (below). Extra columns will automatically be ignored.

@METADATA@

@UNIQID@

@GROUP@

    - **NOTE:** Groups with one element will be excluded from the test.

@RUNORDER@

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Output**

This tool outputs two different files: a TSV file of regression summaries and corresponding flags and a PDF file with fitted regression plots for each feature.  The TSV file contains the values of the regression slope, corresponding p-value and r-squared value together with the flags for two levels of statistical significance (α = 0.05 and α = 0.01.)  The PDF file contains plots for each feature.  The values of the feature are displayed on the plot together with the regression line, bands, slopes, and corresponding p and r-squared values.  The values are colored according to the group that sample belongs to.
