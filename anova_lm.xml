@TIP_AND_WARNING@

**Tool Description**

The tool performs Multiple-Way ANOVA analysis with possible continuous covariates and interactions. 
The analysis is performed row wise independently for each feature. The user has to specify the categorical (factors) variable(s) they want to run analysis over and well as numerical covariate(s) that user wants to account in the model.  The user can also choose whether to include interactions between factors variables in the model or to use simple additive model.
The user has to specify the variables (categorical and numerical) that he/she wants to include in the model and also specify (comma separated) the corresponding type of the variable designated as C (for categorical) and N (for numeric). This will avoid disambiguity when some categorical variables that should be treated as levels are coded in the data as numbers (e.g. batch numbers, indicator variables, flags etc.) The user can choose to include all possible interactions via a checkbox.

- Two input datasets are required.

    @WIDE@

        **NOTE:** The sample IDs must match the sample IDs in the Design File
        (below). Extra columns will automatically be ignored.


    @METADATA@

    **In addition to your datasets, you need to provide:**


    **Unique Feature ID**

    - The column name in your wide dataset that contains the unique IDs for
      your features. In our example dataset you would input *Compound*.
   

    @GROUP@

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Output**

- A TSV that contains the One-Way-ANOVA results and the analysis of means. File headers follow the SAS JMP Genomics conventions (http://www.jmp.com/support/help/).

- A PDF containing, for each sample, various plots of the residuals. Plots include (i) q-q plots to check for normality and (ii) residuals vs fits plots to verify that the residuals are normally distributed.

- A PDF containing volcano plots for visualizing data-points with large changes between group means. The red line shows p = 0.05.
