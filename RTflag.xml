@TIP_AND_WARNING@

**What it does**

This tool identifies features with the following characteristics:
    (1) features whose coefficient of variation in retention time is greater than 90% (default value) of all features and
    (2) features where the difference in the retention time between the 90th and 10th percentiles (default values) is greater than 0.2 seconds.
    (3) features where the difference between the retention time maximum and median is greater than 0.1 seconds.
    (4) features where the difference between the retention time minimum and median is greater than 0.1 seconds.
    (5) features where the retention time minimum or maximum is greater than 3 times the standard deviation away from the mean.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Input**

- Two input datasets are required.

    @WIDE

    **NOTE:** The sample IDs must match the sample IDs in the Design File (below).
    Extra columns will automatically be ignored.


    @METADATA@

**In addition to your datasets, you need to provide:**

    **Unique Compound ID**

        - The column name in your wide dataset that contains the unique IDs for
        your compounds. In our example dataset you would input *Compound*.

    **Cvcutoff**  [Optional]

        - The column name in your design file that contains group information. In
        our example design file we would put *group1*.

    **90th percentile**  [Optional]

    - The default is to flag features when the difference in the retention time between the 90th and 10th percentiles is greater
    than 0.2 seconds. The user has the option to select the 95th and 5th percentiles instead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Output Files**

- The tool generates 2 output datasets.

    **CvplotForRT** is a PNG density plot of the coefficients of variation for the retention time.

    **RTflag** is a TSV file containing the 5 retention time 0/1 indicator flags for each feature.
