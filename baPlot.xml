.. class:: infomark

**TIP:**
If your data is not TAB delimited, use *Text Manipulation-&gt;Convert.*

.. class:: warningmark

**WARNINGS:**
    - (1) A row will be dropped when a pairwise comparison has a missing value.
    - (2) This script automatically removes spaces and special characters from strings.
    - (3) If a compound name starts with a number it will prepend an '_'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What it does**

The Bland-Altman plot (BA-Plot_) is commonly used to look at the concordance of
data between samples, particularly between replicates. This script generates
BA-plots for all pairwise combinations of samples, or, if group information is
provided, for pairwise combinations within the groups.

.. _BA-Plot: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bland%E2%80%93Altman_plot

In addition to generating the BA-plots, a linear regression is performed to
identify (flag) any unusual outlying values. These flags are summarized and
used to generate distribution plots and text files for (i) each sample and for
(ii) each feature (row).

.. class:: infomark

See below for a more in depth description of the output files.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Input**

- Two input datasets are required.

    **Wide Formatted Dataset:**

    A wide formatted dataset that contains measurements for each sample.::

        +----------+---------+---------+---------+-----+
        | Compound | sample1 | sample2 | sample3 | ... |
        +==========+=========+=========+=========+=====+
        | one      | 10      | 20      | 10      | ... |
        | two      | 5       | 22      | 30      | ... |
        | three    | 30      | 27      | 2       | ... |
        | four     | 32      | 17      | 8       | ... |
        | ...      | ...     | ...     | ...     | ... |
        +----------+---------+---------+---------+-----+

    **NOTE:** The sample IDs must match the sample IDs in the Design File
    (below). Extra columns will automatically be ignored.


    **Metadata File:**

    A metadata file relating samples to various groups/treatment.::

        +----------+--------+
        | sampleID | group1 |
        +==========+========+
        | sample1  | g1     |
        | sample2  | g1     |
        | sample3  | g1     |
        | sample4  | g2     |
        | sample5  | g2     |
        | sample6  | g2     |
        | ...      | ...    |
        +----------+--------+

    **NOTE: You must have a column named *sampleID*** and the values in this
    column must match the column names in the wide formatted dataset. Extra
    columns will be ignored.

    **In addition to your datasets, you need to provide:**

    **Unique Feature ID**

    - The column name in your wide dataset that contains the unique IDs for
      your features. In our example dataset you would input *Compound*.

    **Outlier Cutoff – flagging values**

    - Here we use several measures to identify values that are outliers (or leverage points).

        - (1) If the magnitude of the residuals from the linear regression on
              the BA-plot exceeds the user-defined threshold, then a value is flagged
              as an outlier. This cutoff can be adjusted, but the default is 3.

        - (2) If a value is identified as a leverage point using Cook's D with
              a p-value cutoff of 0.5, then the value is flagged. This cannot be
              adjusted.

        - (3) If a value is identified as a leverage point using DFFITS it is
              also flagged. This cannot be adjusted.

    **Sample Flag Cutoff – flagging samples**

    - This cutoff sets the level to flag a sample.

        - Using the above *Outlier Cutoff*, we identify samples that have a
          large number of outlier values. The *Sample Cutoff* is the proportion
          of values for a sample that need to be flagged for that sample to be
          flagged. The default value is 0.2, meaning that 20% of the values need
          to be flagged as outliers for the sample to be flagged as well.

    **Feature Flag Cutoff  – flagging features**

    - This cutoff sets the level to flag a feature.
    - Using the above *Outlier Cutoff*, we identify features with a large
      number of outlier values.  The *Feature Cutoff*, is the proportion of values within
      a feature that need to be flagged for the feature to be flagged. The default value
      is 0.05, meaning that 5% of the values across a feature need to be flagged as
      outliers for the feature to be flagged.

- If you only want to do within group comparisons (**suggested**) then you need
  to specify:

    **Group/Treatment**

    - The column name in your metadata file that contains group information. In
      our example metadata file we would put *group1*.

    **Group ID**

    - This option allows you to specify which groups to analyze (i.e., QC
      samples). Multiple group IDs can be specified by separating them with
      spaces. This option requires that **Group/Treatment** is also specified.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Output Files**

- This tool outputs 4 different files.

    **ba_plots** is a PDF of pairwise scatter plots and BA-plots.

    .. image:: ${static_path}/images/secim/ba_plot.png
        :height: 300
        :width: 600

    The left panel is a scatter plot comparing the two samples. The right
    panel is a BA-plot where the x-axis is the mean between the two samples and y-
    axis is the difference.  Teh solid red line is a regression line and dotted
    lines are 95% confidence intervals. Data highlighted in red are outliers as
    determined by any of the 3 criteria described above.

    **outlier_dist_plots** is a PDF of bar graphs showing the proportion of values determined to be outliers for samples (top) and features (bottom).

    .. image:: ${static_path}/images/secim/ba_plot_outlier_dist_sample.png
        :height: 300
        :width: 600

    .. image:: ${static_path}/images/secim/ba_plot_outlier_dist_feature.png
        :height: 300
        :width: 600


    **flag_sample** is a TSV containing a 0/1 outlier flag for sample where '1'     indicates that the sample was idenfied as an outlier. If a sample is a '1',     you should consider removing the sample.

    +----------+------------------------+
    | sampleID | flag_sample_BA_outlier |
    +==========+========================+
    | as101    | 0                      |
    +----------+------------------------+
    | as102    | 0                      |
    +----------+------------------------+
    | as103    | 1                      |
    +----------+------------------------+
    | ...      | ...                    |
    +----------+------------------------+


    **flag_feature** is a TSV containing a 0/1 flag for each feature where '1'  indicates that the feature was identified as an outlier. If a feature is a      '1', you should consider removing the feature.

    +----------+-------------------------+
    | compound | flag_feature_BA_outlier |
    +==========+=========================+
    | one      | 0                       |
    +----------+-------------------------+
    | two      | 1                       |
    +----------+-------------------------+
    | three    | 0                       |
    +----------+-------------------------+
    | four     | 0                       |
    +----------+-------------------------+
    | ...      | ...                     |
    +----------+-------------------------+
