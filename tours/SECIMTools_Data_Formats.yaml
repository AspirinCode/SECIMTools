  This tour introduces the main types of data formats used by SECIMTools.  A Wide Formatted Dataset should contain feature measurements for each sample with samples in columns and features in rows.  The Design File relates sample values in the wide format dataset with sample characteristics.  On occasion, an Annotation Dataset will be used that links features in the Wide Dataset to feature characteristics such as compound names.  Flag files are datasets produced and used as input by many of the SECIMTools and contain columns of binary indicator values (1/0) to identify specific values.
