name: SECIMTools Blank Feature Filtering (BFF).
description: >-
  This tour shows you how to identify (flag with a 0/1 indicator variable) features (rows) in LC-MS data that are below a specified level of detection.  Blank samples, if present, are used to compute a threshold level of detection.  In the absence of blank samples, a user-specified threshold can be used.
