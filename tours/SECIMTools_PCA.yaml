    content: "This tour will walk you through using the PCA tool.  The tool performs a principal component analysis of the data.<br><br>Visual summaries of the data are provided as 2D and 3D scatter plots.<br><br>Samples can be colored based on group classifications.<br><br>Please see the SECIMTools Galaxy UserGuide for more details about the method (available for download at: http://secim.ufl.edu/education/training/) <br><br> Please visit the Galaxy UI or History Introduction tutorials if you haven't used Galaxy before."
