description: >-
  This tour shows you how to use the Remove Selected Features or Samples tool to remove specific features (rows) or samples (columns).<br><br>
    As an example, this tool can be used to generate a Wide Dataset containing only those features that are signifincantly expressed.

    content: "This tour will walk you through using the Remove Selected Features or Samples.<br><br> 
        The tool uses a Flag file to identify specific features or samples to be removed from a Wide Dataset<br><br> 
        Please see the SECIMTools Galaxy UserGuide for more details about the tool (available for download at: http://secim.ufl.edu/education/training/) <br><br> 
        Please visit the Galaxy UI or History Introduction tutorials if you haven't used Galaxy before."
