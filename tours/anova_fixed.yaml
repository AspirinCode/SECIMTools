  - title: Using SECIMTools to re-scale your data in Galaxy
    content: "This tour will walk you through using the ANOVA tool to fit a fixed effects model with multiple grouping variables, their interations and covariates.<br><br> The analysis is performed independently by feature (row).<br><br>  You can chose whether to include interactions or use a pure additive model.<br><br> Please see the SECIMTools Galaxy UserGuide for more details about the SECIMTools ANOAVA tool (available for download at: http://secim.ufl.edu/education/training/) <br><br> Please visit the Galaxy UI or History Introduction tutorials if you haven't used Galaxy before."
