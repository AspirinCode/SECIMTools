  - title: Using SECIMTools to perform multiple testing adjustments in Galaxy
    content: "This tour will walk you through using the Multiple Testing Adjustment tool to adjust p-values for multiple comparisions using 3 methods.<br><br>
      (1) Bonferonni based on the family-wide error rate, (2) Benjamini/Hochberg based on the false discovery rate (FDR) and (3) Benjamini/Yekutieli based on the FDR.<br><br>
      Please see the SECIMTools Galaxy UserGuide for more details about each method (available for download at: http://secim.ufl.edu/education/training/) <br><br> 
      Please visit the Galaxy UI or History Introduction tutorials if you haven't used Galaxy before."
