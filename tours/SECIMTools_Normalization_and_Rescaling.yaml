    content: "This tour will walk you through using the Normalization and Re-scaling tool.<br><br> The Mean, Sum and Median methods independently re-scale samples while the remaining 6 methods (Centering, Autoscaling, etc.) independently re-scale the data by feature.<br><br>  Please see the SECIMTools Galaxy UserGuide for more details about each normalization/re-scaling method (available for download at: http://secim.ufl.edu/education/training/) <br><br> Please visit the Galaxy UI or History Introduction tutorials if you haven't used Galaxy before."
