    content: "This tour will walk you through using the Coefficient of Variation (CV) tool to calculate CVs (standard deviation as a percent of the mean) for features.<br><br> CVs can be used to look at the consistency of features across samples.<br><br> The user can define what percent of features with high CVs to flag.<br><br> For a detailed tool description, please see the SECIMTools Galaxy UserGuide available for download at: http://secim.ufl.edu/education/training/ <br><br> Please visit the Galaxy UI or History Introduction tutorials if you haven't used Galaxy before."
